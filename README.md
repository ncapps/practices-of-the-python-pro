# Exercises for Practices of the Python Pro üêçüìò

This repository contains the source code for the examples and exercises contained in [Practices of the Python Pro](https://bit.ly/the-python-pro).
The repository is a template repository, so if you'd like to follow along with the book you can [make your own copy](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro/generate).

Each chapter's examples are in their own directory.
In some chapters, you'll find multiple snippets in a single module.
These won't always produce output when you run them, and are occasionally meant only as snippets to demonstrate a concept.
In later chapters, some modules act as an entrypoint to run a program from the command line, importing other modules along the way.
Follow along in the book for more context!

## Notes
### Ch 2. Separation of concerns
- Separation of concerns is a major key to understandable code; many design concepts arise directly from this principle
- Functions extract named concepts from procedural code. Clarity and separation are the primary objectives of extraction; reuse is a secondary benefit.
- Classes group closely related behaviors and data together into an object
- Modules group related classes, functions, and data while keeping independent concerns separate. Explicitly importing code from other modules makes it clear what's being used where.
- Packages help create a hierarchy of modules that helps with naming and code discovery.

### Ch 3. Abstraction and encapsulation
- Abstraction is a tool for deferring obligatory comprehension of code.
- Abstraction takes many forms: decomposition, encapsulation, programming style, and inheritance versus composition.
    - Decomposition is the separation of something into its constituent components
    - Encapsulation groups related functions and data into a larger construct.
    - Programming styles: prodcedural, functional, declarative
    - Composition frees you from the limitations of a hierarchy while still providing the concept of relatedness between two things
- Each approach to abstraction is useful, but context and extent of use are important considerations.
- Refactoring is an iterative process; abstraction that once worked may need to be revisited later.

### Ch 4. Designing for high performance
- Design for performance both up front and iteratively throughout your development.
- *Time complexity* is a measure of how quickly your code can perform a task in relation to its inputs
- *Space complexity* is a measure of how your code uses disk space or memory as its inputs grow.
- The ideal complexity is constant time (O(1)), which doesn‚Äôt depend on the size of the inputs
- It‚Äôs useful to examine the worst case to get a better sense for what the code is capable of. Big O notation always measures the worst-case complexity of code for this reason.
- Think carefully about the right data type for the task.
- Prefer generators over lists when you don‚Äôt need all the values at once, to save on memory usage.
- Use the timeit and cProfile/profile Python modules to test your hypotheses about complexity and performance.
